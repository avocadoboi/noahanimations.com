<h2>Stella Berntsdotter</h2>
<p>
<img class='character-image' id='stella' src='assets/stella_portratt.jpg'>
Stella Berntsdotter is a 19 year old girl who lives in a small, very old townhouse in a very old and small village in the swedish countryside,  probably somewhere in the south. 
She was born and raised in a larger city but moved to the countryside to try out a different lifestyle, to be alone and to find peace. She moved from her mother, her father and her little sister when she was 17, and bought the house from an old friend of the family for a very small price. The house was almost in ruins when Stella bought it and nobody else seemed to want it. Stella did not care for the house’s quality, she moved in and cleaned up the mess. She quickly also got a job at the local newspaper as a reporter.
</p>
<p>
Stella spends her days either writing on her typewriter or being downtown spending time with friends and townsfolk. She has three friends that she spends most of her time with, two of them are also working at the newspaper. When she is writing, she is either working on her own stories or writing something for the newspaper. For the newspaper, she is usually writing about the village’s history and local legends, but also about local events. Her other interests are reading, collecting obscure things, cooking and taking long walks.

<h2>The Lantern Carrier</h2>
<p>
The Lantern Carrier is the spirit of a woman who was murdered inside the house that Stella currently lives in. The name of the woman was Hortensia Ragnarsson when she was still alive, and she worked as a lantern lighter in the village. Her husband was named Wilhelm Ragnarsson and he worked as a train driver. They moved into the house about 60 years before Stella moved in. They had recently gotten married and were planning on getting their first child. But they were very poor and didn’t have the financial opportunity to start a family yet. Life went on, they were waiting and waiting but things would not get any better. Two years later, things did not seem that great for Wilhelm and his job as a train driver, he was on the edge of losing his job as a result of some confusing paperwork. Hortensia was always there for him emotionally but he eventually became mentally ill, started drinking and started meeting other women to get his hopes up. All this happened behind Hortenia’s back. She started to worry when Wilhelm was away for the most time and she started to suspect something.

Then one night after work, Hortensia came home and saw Wilhelm with another woman in their bed. She went mad, took a broomstick and slapped the woman until she ran out of their home. Wilhelm was drunk at this moment and went mad as well but didn’t do anything to Hortensia, yet. Hortensia didn’t want to sleep beside Wilhelm that night, so he had to sleep in the attic. Some time after Hortensia had gone to bed and fallen asleep, Wilhelm woke up. He felt a sensation that he had never felt before, he remembered what Hortensia had done, and suddenly had the urge to do something to her in revenge. He thought about it for a long time and then decided what he would do. He sneaked downstairs into the bedroom where Hortensia was peacefully sleeping, then he took a large pillow that was lying on the floor, pulled it over Hortensia’s face and pressed it down. She woke up and started to struggle but eventually went out of breath and stopped struggling. Wilhelm removed the pillow from her face and was shocked to see that her eyes were fully opened. This imagery creeped Wilhelm out so much that he decided to cut her eyes out of her sockets instead of just closing her eyelids. After the murder was done, Wilhelm felt huge regret, but he had to hide the body somewhere and then flee somewhere and leave this place behind. He thought about the attic, and the hole inside one of the walls. He grabbed Hortensia’s body, put it over his shoulder and went upstairs to the attic. He then put the body inside the wall. He grabbed a hammer, some nails and a couple of boards and started to cover up the hole. When the hole was totally covered, he grabbed his stuff, went out, took the earliest train in the morning and never came back.
